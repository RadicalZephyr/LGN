# Let's Get Naked!

Easily get dressed or undressed to several convenient storage locations.

Adds submenus to the right-click context menu to dress from or undress into the:
 - player inventory (by right clicking in the inventory panel)
 - a selected container
 - the floor at the player's feet

If the container is out of reach of the player, the character will walk to it.

Never removes your belt. Never removes an already worn item of
clothing when dressing. Favorited clothing items will be unequipped
but _will remain in your inventory_. If you think your clothing has disappeared,
**CHECK YOUR INVENTORY**.


### Current Limitations

 - Undressing to the floor always happens at the player's feet.
 - Undressing to inventory only works when right clicking in the inventory panel
 - Cannot undress to backpacks or other worn or carried containers
